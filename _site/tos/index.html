<h4 id="19-indemnity"><strong>19. Indemnity</strong></h4>

<p>You agree to hold harmless, defend and indemnify Kollabo and the Kollabo Providers from all liabilities, losses, damages, deficiencies, claims, causes of action, demands and expenses, (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees), that are due to, arise from or otherwise relate to your conduct or your use or misuse of the Kollabo Service or Materials, including, without limitation, any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim made against Kollabo or any Kollabo Provider that arises out of or relates to: (i) any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of any third party, (ii) your breach of these Terms including without limitation your breach of any of your representations and warranties; (iii) your use of any of the Kollabo Service or Materials; (iv) any content that you store on or transmit through the Kollabo Service; or (v) any items that you mail or ship in connection with the Kollabo Service, including items sold to other Kollabo users. Kollabo may assume exclusive control of any defense of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate with Kollabo in such event.</p>

<h4 id="20-arbitration"><strong>20. Arbitration</strong></h4>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING A JURY TRIAL WAIVER) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH Kollabo AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Kollabo (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS).</p>

<p><strong>A. Binding Arbitration.</strong> Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Kollabo agree (1) to waive your and Kollabo’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, the Kollabo Service or the Materials, resolved in a court, and (2) to waive your and Kollabo’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Kollabo agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>

<p><strong>B. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.</strong> You and Kollabo agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Kollabo Service or the Materials is personal to you and Kollabo and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Kollabo agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which the individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Kollabo agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals. The limitations imposed by this Section 20(B) shall apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against Kollabo related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this Section 20(B) shall be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>C. Federal Arbitration Act.</strong> You and Kollabo agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 20 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>D. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> You and Kollabo agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Kollabo shall be sent by an email to legal@kollabo.io. Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Account, and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (2) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address you used to register for your Account, and will include (a) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and Kollabo cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Kollabo may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 20, commence an arbitration proceeding, or to the extent specifically provided for in section 20(A), file a claim in court.</p>

<p><strong>E. Process.</strong> Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Kollabo agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Kollabo within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Kollabo will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and Kollabo agree that (1) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (2) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (3) that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Clara County County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>

<p><strong>F. Authority of the Arbitrator.</strong> As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

<p><strong>G. Rules of JAMS.</strong> The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a>. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (1) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (2) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

<p><strong>H. Severability.</strong> If any term, clause or provision of this Section 20 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 20 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 20(B) are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>I. Opt-Out Right.</strong> You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 20 by writing an email to: legal@kollabo.io. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 21.</p>

<h4 id="21-governing-law-venue"><strong>21. Governing Law; Venue.</strong></h4>

<p>These Terms, your access to and use of the Kollabo Service and Materials shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of</p>

<p>California without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County, California.</p>

<h4 id="22-miscellaneous"><strong>22. Miscellaneous</strong></h4>

<p><strong>A. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence.</strong> These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Kollabo Service. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with Kollabo for the Kollabo Service or for any other Kollabo product, feature, service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with Kollabo, the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement.</p>

<p><strong>B. Amendments.</strong> We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email and/or by posting the amended Terms via the Kollabo Service and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. All amended Terms will become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the Kollabo Service unless we state otherwise via our notice of such amended Terms. Any amended Terms will apply prospectively to use of the Kollabo Service after such changes become effective. Your continued use of the Kollabo Service following the effective date of such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Kollabo Service.</p>

<p><strong>C. Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision will not affect the enforceability of such provision under other circumstances, or of the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>D. Waiver.</strong> Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof.</p>

<p><strong>E. Relationship.</strong> Kollabo is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee. You are not an agent of Kollabo.</p>

<p><strong>F. Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from Kollabo, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. Kollabo may assign or transfer any or all of its rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.</p>

<p><strong>G. Headings.</strong> Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections.</p>

<p><strong>H. Survival.</strong> Sections 16 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 18 (Limitation of Liability), 19 (Indemnity), 20 (Arbitration), 21 (Governing Law; Venue), this Section 22 (Miscellaneous), and any other term that, by its nature, should survive, will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p>
